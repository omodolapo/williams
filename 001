            <i>In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the smallest sequence of </i>
            phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. For many 
            languages, words also correspond to sequences of graphemes ("letters") 
            in their standard writing systems that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter
             space, or by other graphical conventions.[1] The concept of "word" is usually distinguished from that
              of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of speech which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own.
            
            In many languages, the notion of what constitutes a "word" may be mostly learned as part of learning the 
            writing system.[1] This is the case of the English language, and of most languages that are written with 
            alphabets derived from the ancient Latin or Greek alphabets.
            
            There still remains no consensus among linguists about the proper definition of "word" in a spoken language 
            that is independent of its writing system, nor about the precise distinction between it and "morpheme".[1] This 
            issue is particularly debated for Chinese and other languages of East Asia,[2] and may be moot[clarification needed] for Afro-Asiatic languages.
            
            In English orthography, the letter sequences "rock", "god", "write", "with", "the", "not" are considered to be 
            single-morpheme words, whereas "rocks", "ungodliness", "typewriter", and "cannot" are words composed of two or 
            more morphemes ("rock"+"s", "un"+"god"+"li"+"ness", "type"+"writ"+"er", and "can"+"not"). In English and many other languages, 
            the morphemes that make up a word generally include at least one root (such as "rock", "god", "type", "writ", "can", "not") and
             possibly some affixes ("-s", "un-", "-ly", "-ness"). Words with more than one root ("[type][writ]er", "[cow][boy]s", "[tele]
             [graph]ically") are called compound.
